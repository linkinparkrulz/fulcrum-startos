# Fulcrum
A fast & nimble SPV server for Bitcoin.

## Configuration
Select your Bitcoin node as a backend.  Currently, Bitcoin Core is supported, with options for mainnet or testnet.

## Usage
After configuring, simply "Start" the service.  This will begin syncing your indexer.  This may take quite some time, up to 1-2 days, depending on your hardware.
